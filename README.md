# Data preprocessing - NYC Motor Vehicle Crashes project

Must-have features

    The dataset contains no missing values ("" or null)
    No duplicates.
    Values are consolidated
    Data format is correct
    No blank spaces (ex: " I love python " => "I love python")

Nice-to-have features

    The more rows of data you use, the better. However, pay attention that the more data you have, the longer each operation needs to execute.
    Add new features computed using the features present that you think are going to be useful.
    Apply the preprocessing steps needed so that a future machine learning model can make the best use out of it (feature selection, feature engineering, feature normalization,    and resampling). You have to decide which one are necessary and which ones aren't.


Deliverables

    Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
    Create final .csv file with the cleaned dataset
    Pimp up the readme file:
        What, Why, When, How, Who.
        Pending things to do
